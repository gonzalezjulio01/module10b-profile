# Module 10B
## Dynamic Musician Profile

## Description
This React project creates a musician profile card using props to pass the artist's information and useState to toggle the visibility of a personal quote. It demonstrates interactivity and dynamic rendering with a unique layout and color scheme.

## What I Learned
- How to customize React components for different themes.
- How `useState` works for toggling elements in the UI.
- How to combine inline styles with gradient backgrounds and shadows.
- How to design a component that looks distinct yet functional.

## Challenges
The challenge was adjusting text visibility against a gradient background. I solved this by applying contrast-friendly colors and semi-transparent containers.
